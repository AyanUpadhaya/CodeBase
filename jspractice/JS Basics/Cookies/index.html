	<!-- What are Cookies?

	A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. You also might have enjoyed the benefits of cookies knowingly or unknowingly. Have you ever saved your Facebook password so that you do not have to type it each and every time you try to login? If yes, then you are using cookies. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.

	<!-- 
		Why do you need a Cookie?

	The communication between a web browser and server happens using a stateless protocol named HTTP. Stateless protocol treats each request independent. So, the server does not keep the data after sending it to the browser. But in many situations, the data will be required again. Here come cookies into a picture. With cookies, the web browser will not have to communicate with the server each time the data is required. Instead, it can be fetched directly from the computer.

	 <!-- You can create cookies using document. cookie property like this.

	document.cookie = "cookiename=cookievalue" 
	-->

	<!-- You can even add expiry date to your cookie so that the particular cookie will be removed from the computer on the specified date. The expiry date should be set in the UTC/GMT format. If you do not set the expiry date, the cookie will be removed when the user closes the browser.

	document.cookie = "cookiename=cookievalue; expires= Thu, 21 Aug 2014 20:00:00 UTC"
